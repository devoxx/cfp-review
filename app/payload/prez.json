    "summary": "Every frontend developer knows the problem, the project you are working on requires a control that is not part of the standard library which raises the question...“How to do a custom control myself ?“ This talk will show you one way you could choose to create those custom controls in JavaFX. The internal structure of a JavaFX control with it‘s different parts like control, skin, behavior and css file will be explained. In addition the differences between a Java Swing component and a JavaFX control will be shown to give the audience with a Swing background an idea on how to convert existing Java Swing components to JavaFX controls. In addition it will be shown how one could get an existing design converted into a control. Therefore a small control will be created in a drawing program and afterwards be converted into code using different approaches like SVG to FXML, FXG to FXML and FXG to Java code.",
