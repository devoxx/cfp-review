    "summary": "Every frontend developer knows the problem, the project you are working on requires a control that is not part of the standard library which raises the question...“How to do a custom control myself ?“ This talk will show you one way you could choose to create those custom controls in JavaFX. The internal structure of a JavaFX control with it‘s different parts like control, skin, behavior and css file will be explained. In addition the differences between a Java Swing component and a JavaFX control will be shown to give the audience with a Swing background an idea on how to convert existing Java Swing components to JavaFX controls. In addition it will be shown how one could get an existing design converted into a control. Therefore a small control will be created in a drawing program and afterwards be converted into code using different approaches like SVG to FXML, FXG to FXML and FXG to Java code.",

Each jar can contain a part of the war, the necessary java code needed for this war, the application server configuration files or the properties files used for internationalization.\r\nGoing further in the modularity/agility issue, the developers use a modifed version of tomcat's default class loader which offer hot reloading of their Java code. This also makes the reloading of extension points, fragments and templates possible.",

ElasticMQ is written in Scala; I will show examples where Scala was especially useful (e.g. the Cake Pattern). The libraries are also interesting: JGroups is a really easy way to implement replication; Squeryl offers type-safe SQL queries; and Netty is the way to build an asynchronous HTTP server. These will be short intros so that you feel encouraged to play at home. \r\n\r\nThe project is fully open-source. You are encouraged to fork at: https://github.com/adamw/elasticmq.",

      "speakerBio": "I am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, a company specialising in delivering customised software solutions (http://softwaremill.com, \"Extraordinary software as a standard\"), based on Java, Scala and JBoss technologies. I graduated from the University of Warsaw, receiving a Master's Degree in Computer Science. I am also involved in some open-source projects. Firstly as the founder and lead developer of Hibernate Envers, a Hibernate core module, which provides entity versioning/auditing capabilities; Envers is also included in JBoss AS since version 7.0.2. Secondly, as the founder of ElasticMQ, an SQS-compatible messaging server written in Scala.\r\n\r\nMoreover I work on several small projects around static analysis (using JSR 308 - Typestate Annotations/ Checkers Framework and FindBugs), and some CDI/Weld (not always portable) extensions, like autofactories or stackable security interceptors. I am also interested in improving the ways we use Dependency Injection, and some simple electronics using Arduino/RaspberryPi/Lego. When not working, I enjoy hiking in the mountains (summer), skiing (winter), playing tennis and since June 2010, spending time with my daughter.\r\n\r\nI have been a speaker at numerous conferences, including Devoxx, Jazoon, Confitura, JDD and Herbstcampus, as well as on Warsaw, Poznan and Riviera JUGs.\r\n\r\nMy blog: http://www.warski.org/blog",

We'll then compare PaaS APIs, provided resources and replacements, and discuss ways of separating your core portable business logic from your \"PaaS binding\". \r\n\r\nFinally, we'll look at \"live-from-IDE\" development, continuous integration and deployment options and touch on monitoring and application management in a multi-PaaS setup.",

But there are dozens of BDD tools for the JVM out there: how do you know what to use, and when? In this talk, we will look at the various BDD tools available for Java developers, both in Java and in other JVM languages. We will look at the pros and cons of the various tools, and learn which might be best suited for your team. Finally, you will discover the relationship between behavior driven development and automated acceptance testing, and why you probably need both.",

In fact, there are many ways to dramatically improve your code quality using a more functional style today! This talk will discuss how techniques such as functional programming, fluent APIs and other clean coding practices can make your code more concise, more readable, and much easier to maintain.

This presentation describes four real-world case studies of customers who weren’t ‘in the room’, how this compromised agile software development, how we communicated with the customer instead, and why agile software development techniques still had something to offer.\r\n\r\nCase studies:\r\n\r\n# The customer who had already written a functional specification\r\n# The customer who we didn’t see for the whole project\r\n# The customer who didn’t know that the team was using Scrum\r\n# The customer who emigrated to Australia during the project",

However, although agile methods improve on traditional processes, they neither replace the need for basic techniques or teach them. This presentation teaches the essential practical techniques that you need whatever method you are using, agile or not: \r\n\r\n* essential project documentation - telling stakeholders what you’re doing\r\n* functional design - communicating requirements to programmers\r\n* software development estimation - making cost predictions\r\n* essential system documentation - avoiding being on-call for ever.\r\n\r\nWriting everything down up-front is easy (but a bad idea): the art of being agile is knowing what you can leave out while still addressing all of a development project’s issues. This session teaches you how.",

But JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, dynamically typed language. JavaScript functions are the first class citizens that can live their own lives. But mastering JavaScript can present a challenge to Java developers who quickly find themselves in the Wild West Land of dynamic programming.\r\n\r\nWhy you may want to learn JavaScript? \r\n\r\nFirst, learning how things done in another language makes you a better Java developer. \r\nSecond, HTML5 becomes a new buzzword and adding JavaScript to your skill set make you more valuable software developer. You may not know the best kept secret – any HTML5 project is about learning some new tags, APIs and CSS,but mainly it’s about writing JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this presentation is to introduce you to this interesting language highlighting the differences with the Java way of doing stuff.",

However, business logic and data services would typically be coded using JavaScript or native (e.g. Objective-C) code – neither are ideal for most Java developers. In this session, we will discuss a new framework (Oracle Application Development Framework Mobile) that enable developers to declaratively create HTML5-based user interfaces using JavaServer Faces-like components. For business logic and data services, developers can either declaratively define or code in Java to create these service components. The exact same modules and code would run on both iOS and Android devices. Furthermore, the framework integrates PhoneGap to provide strong device integration, which allows Java developers to create powerful mobile application across different device types. Includes demos on iOS and Android.",

He’s recently been very interested in functional languages and the decision to study a few ones – Clojure, F#, JRuby and Scala – shapes his current self-learning activities. He also keeps on eye on current developments in Android and OSGi technology areas. He’s the founder and a co-leader of the Warszawa Java User Group (Warszawa JUG) that runs the Confitura and warsjawa conferences in Warsaw, Poland. He’s a book reviewer of IT books, mostly about Java EE, but you may check it out yourself whether or not that still holds true.\r\nHe is a Certified IT Specialist (Level 2) for IBM WebSphere in IBM Poland, so you might find a pinch of a bias towards IBM WebSphere stuff here and there.

If you've ever considered concurrent programming in Java, you know it's hard to do it right. With Clojure it's much easier and hence it's often referred to as \"a small library for concurrent programming\".",

Android rise pretty fast thanks to large developer community of Java.\r\nHowever in real world Android is not alone! Many mobile devices running iOS and Blackberry are also exist in mobile universe. \r\nHTML5+phonegap apps promised a magic silverbullet for write once run on all devices approach via several frameworks which in the end offered painful javascript and css development. While GWT offers a great Java to JS compiler and debugger, MGWT introduces native looking widgets both on ios, android and even blackberry. Also with the addition of gwt-phonegap projects, now you can code native looking html apps which can use native apis only with regular Java without coding a single line of html+JS.\r\nThis talk had been highly rated at Android Dev Days Istanbul and Ankara also still waiting for approval to be on JavaOne 2012.",

However, before considering performance the site must work reliably across all required devices.  In recent years many of the approaches adopted to achieve high performance rely on the excessive use of JavaScript or techniques supported by only a limited set of devices.  These approaches lead to reduced reliability and support across different devices and higher testing and maintenance costs.  This talk will describe multiple techniques used to progressively enhance performance for web sites without reducing device support.",

    "summary": "For Java developers who want to work with the language and platform they love, the last two years have proven to be ground-breaking ones. Java SE 7 was released after a long five-year and brought many new features to make a Java programmer’s life simpler. Such features include reduced generics syntax, safe file handling, making large numbers etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, wouldn’t it be fun to be able to add your own favourite features to Java?\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we give an introduction to hacking the Java compiler by showing you how to implement a relatively simple new language syntax feature: the Elvis operator.\r\n\r\nYou will learn:\r\n- how to download and build the Java compiler source code\r\n- how a compiler works and an overview of the Java compiler architecture\r\n- how to modify the Java syntax and grammar\r\n- how to implement the Elvis operator as a feature of Java\r\n- how to test your implementation",

We'll dive into Chrome Dev Tools, explore the new W3C performance specs and what they can offer, and investigate several case studies to illustrate the common pitfalls. By the end of the session, you'll be able to shave several seconds off your page load time - yes, all in the frontend! \r\n\r\nAnd for the backend geeks, we'll take a quick look at lessons learned with SPDY, talk about open source page optimization (and automation) tools like PageSpeed, and also take a quick foray into the optimizations for the mobile web.",

    "summary": "Software development organisations can use a policy of transparency, varied Internet-based communication tools and the occasional programmer with social skills to remove the need to have a dedicated project manager for every development team. The obvious benefits are smaller teams, more efficient projects and reduced costs. The less obvious benefit is that project management gets more interesting as a result.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t possible for every project or team, but allows the smaller and easier projects to scale down and get done faster with a smaller team. Meanwhile, specialist project managers can focus on the hard project management problems or expand the scope of their roles.\r\n\r\nThis talk explains how this can work in practice, why it can be difficult, and how your organisation might make it fail. This a practical talk for working project managers and software developers, based on real projects, not a theoretical discussion.",

    "summary": "There has been a strong connection between the terms \"web\" and \"offline\" for years. The rise of HTML5 and the support of offline mode in most modern browers changed the play of the game. Web applications are able to be run in an offline mode, thanks to HTML5 support for client-side storage for data and static assets. Since 15% of all mobile apps are launched when they the device is offline, it is quite likely you are going to have to deal with the offline data experience in your projects. This session will introduce the different ways of storing data on the client as well as pointing out the limitation of each of the different techniques.",

Yet when something goes wrong, would you know how to solve it? In this session we'll take a tour of the Java class loading mechanism, both from JVM and developer point of view. We will look at typical problems that you get with class loading and how to solve them. ClassNoDefError, IncompatibleClassChangeError, LinkageError and many others are symptoms of specific things going wrong that you can usually find and fix. For each problem we'll go through a hands on demo with a corresponding solution.",

    "summary": "Today, there are several trends that are forcing application architectures to evolve. Users expect a rich, interactive and dynamic user experience on a wide variety of clients including mobile devices. Applications must be highly scalable, highly available and run on cloud environments. Organizations often want to frequently roll out updates, even multiple times a day. Consequently, it’s no longer adequate to develop simple, monolithic web applications that serve up HTML to desktop browsers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we describe the limitations of a monolithic architecture. You will learn how to use the scale cube to decompose your application into a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable back-end services and an HTML 5 client. We will also discuss the role of technologies such as NodeJS and AMQP brokers. You will learn how a modern PaaS such as Cloud Foundry simplifies the development and deployment of this style of application.",

    "summary": "Developing web applications used to be simple. Your single war-file web application served up HTML to a desktop browser and used a relational database. Today however, web applications are much more complex: the front-end uses HTML5 and NodeJS, the middle tier is decomposed into multiple services, and the back-end uses a mix of SQL and NoSQL databases. Developing these kind of applications can be challenging since there are so many moving parts that need to be correctly installed and configured. Deployment is even more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn why we need to build applications with this architectural style and how Cloud Foundry, which is modern, multi-lingual, multi-service, extensible open-source PaaS, can help. We will talk about how to develop modern applications that run on Cloud Foundry and cover what’s new and different about the cloud environment. You will learn how your application can consume the various services that are provided by Cloud Foundry.",

They can simplify the persistence of complex data models and offer significantly better scalability and performance. However, using a NoSQL database means giving up the benefits of the relational model such as SQL, constraints and ACID transactions. For some applications, the solution is polyglot persistence: using SQL and NoSQL databases together.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of polyglot persistence and how to design applications that use this approach. We will explore the architecture and implementation of an example application that uses MySQL as the system of record and Redis as a very high-performance database that handles queries from the front-end. You will learn about mechanisms for maintaining consistency across the various databases.",

    "summary": "Traditional market data vendors receive quotes from exchanges and deliver them to the customers using C or C++ feed handlers. However, big enterprise systems that receive those quotes and deliver them to the customers' trading terminals are written in Java. Integration between native feed handlers and Java frontends is performed either via JNI or on the binary protocol level. It entailsvarious technical and organization difficulties. It is not easy to deliver them millions of quotes into the Java world, unless Java was kept in mind in the design of the system from the ground up.\r\n\r\nI will share the success story of dxFeed -- a pure Java market data vendor that outperforms many traditional data vendors. What is so hard about handling millions of market data events? What makes it especially hard in Java? What Java-specific design and architectural decisions were made at the beginning to make it possible, and how 100% pure Java solution ultimately makes the life of all developers easier.",

Going step-by-step through various hibernate-related issues in our exemplary application, we explain such performance anti-patterns as inefficient collection mappings, inappropriate types for owning and inverse sides, read-only and transaction issues, and others. For each anti-pattern a better solution is presented along with an automated refactoring performed by Yonita Optimizer for Hibernate to achieve the optimal performance, yet guarantee the same semantics. In the end, the execution times of the refactored application prove the achieved performance gain. Additionally, we also present the results of optimization for an open-source projects, including the before and after execution times along with the refactored code available to download.",

We discuss performance anti-patterns related to slow data structures, inefficient data- and call-flows, and suboptimal critical sections. Then, we explain how such anti-patterns can be refactored to more appropriate structures applying the best strategy based on their usage patterns, yet guaranteeing the same semantic.

Have you ever struggled with slow JPA performance? Are you in need for speed? What about scalability? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, four frameworks: EclipseLink, Hibernate, DataNucleus, and OpenJPA compete for the title of the fastest and most scalable JPA implementation. We compare, contrast, and explain performance characteristics of these JPA implementations, mainly focusing on mappings of complex structures (specifically collections and sub-objects), JPQL efficiency, and caching. The test-cases for growing data sets reveal a speedily increasing curve of execution times. The presented code examples along with execution times show the differences among various JPA providers, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and providing the estimates for acceptable data volumes and numbers of concurrent sessions.",

When we write a game we want them to run on as many different devices as we can.

Companies like Google, Adobe and even Microsoft are going the HTML5 route and stopping development on Silverlight and Flash Mobile in favor of HTML5 standards. Now HTML5 is not done yet, but there are a lot of advantages in using it, especially when developing for mobile. In this presentation I'm going to show some examples how HTML5 when used as a Mobile development platform can make for platform independence. I'll show some examples and talk about some of the frameworks that people can use to get started building the applications of tomorrow. There will be some live coding during this session to give an idea of how easy it can be to use the latest HTML5 standards to create a small application with phonegap and mGWT.",

But how could you pimp your software without rewriting all of it. JavaFX offers a nice solution for this kind of problem...the JfxPanel. With the help of this control it's possible to embedd all the new fancy JavaFX stuff in your \"old\" Java Swing based software. The nice thing about this fact is that you will not only get the ability to use the effects of JavaFX but also the HTML5 capable WebView control that comes with JavaFX.

For the past 2 years, Mark Stephens has been working on using HTML5 and javafx/FXML to produce a decent representation of PDF file content - in many ways the most sophisticated display format out there. Just how good are these new technologies and how do they stack up? \r\n\r\nSo come along and find out how to use Javafx and HTML5. Find out what they offer and how you can draw on both, get lots of tips on how to push them to their limits, see how you can easily move between them and discover what their weak points are. It is time for the big show down (and guaranteed cutest kitten pictures in any Devoxx talk).",

As a Java developer, you may have glanced at how other languages on the JVM solve many problems in a simpler, more elegant way by using the functional paradigm. Lambdas in Java 8 will address many of these issues, but what is less known is that it's actually possible to leverage some of the functional-style techniques even today. In this session, you’ll learn about real-world experiences with functional frameworks such as LambdaJ, Functional Java and Guava. What should you consider before adopting them? How do they compare against one another? If you want to be prepared for the functional future of Java 8, getting to know these techniques now will put you ahead of the curve!",

REST Assured is an open source Java DSL that allows you to avoid boiler-plate code to make requests and validate even complex responses in a simple manner. Come and see how easily you can validate e.g. XML and JSON payloads by making use of Groovy data structures and closures from Java using a simple BDD-like syntax. It also comes with support for popular authentication schemes, integrates flawlessly with JUnit and TestNG and much more. Testing and validating REST services in Java cannot be much simpler!",

Agile is no silver bullet. During this talk Sander Hoogendoorn, global agile thought leader at Capgemini, shows how agile projects will fail independent of the process used. Sander elaborates on agile anti-patterns such as Scrumdamentalism, Agile-In-Name-Only, Pseudo-Iterations, guesstimation, Bob-the-Builder Syndrome, Parkinson’s Law, Student Syndrome. With embarrassing anecdotes from real-life projects.",

    "summary": "A session on some of the underlying concepts of Agile software development. This without touching specific methodologies or frameworks, but with focusing on the principles, values and human aspects. I will handle topics around business driven fail early lifecycles, empirical processes and knowledge work. The take away is that people have an understanding of why some practices and principles should be applied in software development in order to become more Agile. And the reason to become more Agile is to increase productivity, effectiveness, time to market and motivation. I’ve classified it under senior because it might be a bit difficult for people that have little to no experience in working on software projects.\r\n\r\nRemark on Slideware: This a first beta version of the slides and these will be enhanced.",

People who failed in building modular systems often times propagate a couple of arguments like:\r\n* The tools and processes to maintain a modular system are way too complex and therefor way too expensive.\r\n* There are very few prominent real world examples of modular software systems. That causes some people to think that modular software systems only exist in theory and that you cannot build and maintain such a system practically.\r\n* A lot of projects try to build a modular software system by introducing 'OSGi'. This approach is doomed if there is no modular system first.\r\nWe want to tell some stories about our experience while we moved our monolithic system into a decoupled modular system.

Makes life easier when deploying OSGi applications.\r\n* ServiceLoader Mediator spec - makes it possible to use java.util.ServiceLoader in OSGi.\r\n* Common Namespaces spec - adds additional types of capabilities to the generic capabilities and requirements model introduced in OSGi R4.3.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will show how these specs can be used in practice.

Here are some examples: \r\n- Can you explain to me why there are way so many features in your software that aren't used? \r\n- Do you just release your software when it is ready? And this is just twice a year?\r\n- Are you keep discussing about details without writing a single line of code?\r\n- Why are you spending most of your time implementing features from people who scream the loudest or have the strongest opinions? \r\nYour comfort zone is comfortable because it's what you know. I'm sure everybody has pretty good arguments as to why the status quo is good, but if we want to become awesome we have to tackle these assumptions and norms. So let's embrace things that suck and attack them.\r\nThis session shows typical cultural anti-patterns and gives some hints how to fix the problems to become even more awesome.",

The team that built it came from writing web applications in Java 1.4 for a proprietary platform where it took up to a week just to deploy a new release after it had passed mostly manual QA. \r\nWith this new project the team rebooted itself: we adopted Scrum and started building the SAP ID Service using a lean, modern and standards-based application server built from open source components and using Continuous Delivery for build, test and deployment. We are now at the stage where each commit leads to a build with automated test coverage via Cucumber followed by a blue/green deployment to a production-like QA landscape which is provisioned from a cloud and configured automatically using Chef. A similar deployment to production is just a couple of clicks away, and the cloud-based technology used for this also enables developers to provision their own landscapes using a simple web-based tool.",

These practices are intuitive and sufficient for smaller systems, but as systems grow larger, more teams are involved, working in more locations, things are not so obvious. It gets more and more difficult to build a shared vision among everybody involved... without regressing to BDUF ... and you'll need to actively work on something that nature gets for free: Kill the unfit.",

Much of the development of these capabilities has been driven by the search for more natural ways to interact with games (the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect are great examples).\r\n\r\nThis session will look at how to build a great looking user iterface with JavaFX that can then use an array of different sensors and hardware to provide a more natural, gestural style of interface.  We’ll look at pros and cos of things like the Wiimote from Nintendo, the Kinect sensor from Micrososft and the recently announced Leap Motion high definition motion sensor.  We’ll even include the use of an EEG monitor from Neurosky so that the interface can be controlled just by thinking about it.\r\n\r\nThe session will include plenty of code samples and some great demonstrations of what’s possible.",

    "summary": "Certain types of apps require low latency responses to meet all of their requirements.  The JVM makes developer’s lives easier in many ways by handling things like memory management and thread synchronisation.  To improve performance the JVM also uses numerous techniques to adaptively compile bytecodes into native instructions and library calls.  The drawback of these approaches is the non-deterministic reality of app profiles, which can be a major obstacle for those requiring very small latency of response.\r\n\r\nThis session looks at the 2 greatest issues when tuning the JVM for low latency: garbage collection and adaptive compilation.  We’ll look at how things like the introduction of the Garbage First (G1) collector and convergence of the HotSpot & JRockit virtual machines offers greater flexibility in tuning the JVM for optimal response times.  We’ll also discuss some of the coding practices that can be employed when developing Java apps making it easier to work with the JVM, rather than against it.",

In the last years, several modern languages such as Clojure, Jython, JRuby, Groovy and Scala emerged for the JVM besides the almighty Java to improve the programming experience.\r\n\r\nThis progress report shows which modern languages we use in our projects besides Java and why we use them. The main goal is to provide information about the business value of introducing additional languages. Nevertheless, some code examples will be shown, too. \r\n\r\nThe session shows several advantages of these languages and why a few of them should be considered at least in some parts of many projects. Of course, some non-negligible problems have to be solved when introducing new JVM languages besides Java. This sessions also describes these problems and gives hints how to solve them.",

If you do not consider them, your next BPM project may fail too...\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, the session describes what BPM really is. Afterwards, several myths about BPM are discussed. Many people even do not know when to use BPM, and when not to use it. Besides, the session introduces important and less important standards, and why BPM is not just tooling. However, the right tooling is a critical success factor, too. Therefore, different tools and products are presented to be able to choose the correct one for a specific BPM project.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, the audience will know how to do BPM correctly by following some simple, but crucial rules.",

    "summary": "Data exchanges between companies increase a lot. The number of applications which must be integrated increases, too. The interfaces use different technologies, protocols and data formats. Nevertheless, the integration of these applications shall be modeled in a standardized way, realized efficiently and supported by automatic tests.\r\n\r\nApache Camel is an integration framework, which fulfils these requirements. It implements the well-known Enteprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and therefore offers a standardized domain-specific language to integrate applications. All integration projects can be realized in a consistent way without redundant boilerplate code.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency is even more increased through the use of modern JVM languages. Apache Camel can be used with Java, XML, Groovy, Scala, Clojure, JRuby, Kotlin, and others. This session discusses how to gain most benefits by using the right language for the right systems integration job.",

    "summary": "In many ways, Java EE 7 is certainly an evolutionary revision of the EE platform, delivering incremental improvements of existing technologies and standards. However, some aspects of the platform are, in a subtle way, rather revolutionary. Together with the advances of client-side web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, Web sockets or JavaScript libraries and frameworks, Java EE 7 will accelerate the transition to a new breed of applications, in which the client side completely drives the user interface. Going forward, tools will play a crucial role in this transition. In this BOF, we will discuss how Java EE 7 will enable both incremental improvements of existing tools, as well as new tools that support the new application model.",

Very few resources explain how to use these mechanisms effectively (recipes) and in particular how to refactor existing code into well defined modules with properly defined external APIs, implementation bindings and documented dependencies. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we propose to show design patterns we encountered when refactoring existing code to use effectively the powers of Dependency Injection. \r\n\r\nExamples :\r\n\t- Contract/Service paradigm : define your APIs, hide your implementation, use Binding to publish.\r\n\t- The @Named code smell.\r\n\t- Use BindingAnnotations when multiple implementation exists\r\n\t- The disappearance of the Context object\r\n\t- Use Scoping everywhere. \r\n\t- Use Explicit Binding unless you support plugins/runtime extensibility.\r\n\r\nWe expect to show around 10~15 recipes with actual code demonstrating the patterns and anti-patterns",

      "speakerBio": "Vincent Partington is a technology entrepreneur and an Internet industry veteran with over 15 years of experience. Vincent’s passion for technology began while studying computer science at the University of Amsterdam where Vincent was involved heavily in the then budding Internet scene in Amsterdam, working at the first free Internet service (De Digitale Stad) from 1995 onwards. After graduating in 1997, he continued his work in the Internet industry. He quickly stumbled upon what was later to become J2EE and delivered his first Enterprise Java application in 1998.\r\n\r\nAfter working in the Java EE space at different companies, Vincent Partington joined Xebia, in 2003. At Xebia, Vincent performed a whole range of assignments covering the spectrum of the activities of Xebia IT Architects: middleware architecture, automated build and deployment systems, performance tuning, security assessments, SOA architecture and numerous software audits. He has also taught a number of courses on Enterprise Java topics such as security and the Spring framework\r\n\r\nSeeing a need for standard Java EE deployment automation, Vincent Partington founded the startup XebiaLabs in the summer of 2008. After delivering the first version of the product to launching customer KLM, the product, Deployit, was extended to not only support WebSphere Application Server but a host of other middleware platforms including Oracle WebLogic Server, JBoss Application Server and Tomcat. As the Chief Technical Officer of XebiaLabs Vincent is involved in development of the product and research into new features and new directions for the product.\r\n\r\nVincent Partington holds a masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.",

For example:\r\n- Seven years later, have generics helped reduce type casts and code duplication? \r\n- Covariant arrays are often seen as a language design error, but do programmers care?\r\n- What do programmers use wildcards for?\r\n- How do programmers use overloading? Could it be replaced with other features?\r\n- Are checked exceptions really beneficial?",

Furthermore some of the old types of digital signatures will be deprecated.\r\nIn his talk, Bruno will guide you through the world of digital signing using a plethora of examples (including a demo on how to sign a document using the javax.smartcardio package). He'll focus on the best practices regarding signing, so that developers can make their applications future-proof.\r\nTarget audience: developers who don't want to write code creating digital signatures that will be deprecated in 2013, or who want to update their existing code, making it \"PDF 2.0-ready\".",

Whether it’s DSL’s, closures (Project Lambda), aspects, CDI, or annotations, fundamental changes have and are occurring that are loosely classified as syntactic sugar.  This presentation takes a step back by having an open and honest discussion from two different perspectives from an advocate for the syntactic sugar and a pragmatic engineer that sees some of it as syntactic salt.  Whether you see these elements as sugar or salt, you can take a step back and assess whether these elements really simplify the code or make the code more complex.",

For enterprise applications, the look and style of an application were often afterthoughts, but now they’re among the top considerations.

JavaFX is well situated to help you design applications that will impress any customer. This session shows how to build well-designed applications with JavaFX and features such as CSS, Scene Builder, and custom controls.",

JavaFX Scene Builder is a design tool for the JavaFX platform, and it allows for a simple drag-and-drop positioning of GUI components onto a JavaFX scene, generating the correspondent FXML code.  This tool, working together with NetBeans, provides everything developers need to have to take advantage of JavaFX new features and put it together with their already existent app.\r\n\r\nLearn everything you need to know about the JavaFX Scene Builder and NetBeans features supporting JavaFX like runtime scene graph snapshots, debugging/profiling apps, and more.",

    "summary": "Certain types of apps require low latency responses to meet all of their requirements.  The JVM makes developer’s lives a lot easier in many ways by handling things like memory management and thread synchronisation.  To improve performance the JVM also uses numerous techniques to adaptively compile bytecodes into native instructions and library calls.  The drawback of these approaches is the non-deterministic reality of app profiles, which can be a major obstacle for those requiring very small latency of response.\r\n\r\nThis session will look at the two greatest issues when tuning the JVM for low latency: garbage collection and adaptive compilation.  We’ll look at how things like the introduction of the Garbage First (G1) collector and convergence of the HotSpot and JRockit VMs offers greater flexibility in tuning the JVM for optimal response times.  We’ll also discuss some of the coding practices that can be employed when developing Java apps making it easier to work with the JVM, rather than against it.",

But yet, most meetings are dull, monopolized by a few and more often than not they produce no satisfying results.\r\n\r\nBut in recent years a new trend emerged to fight the abyss of unproductive meetings: Gamestorming - creative games instead of endless discussions. In this talk we will explore why Gamestorming is so successful, why games are not only more fun, but can help us to generate more and better ideas, too.

    "summary": "Not all puzzles are easily solvable with a brute force loop to try every combination. Sometimes the search space is just too large and there is no smart, exact algorithm to solve it either. Many business planning problems, such as vehicle routing, employee rostering, task scheduling and bin packing fall into this category. Yet, humans still solve them every day. Can computers do a better job?\r\n\r\nYes, they can, resulting in schedules with lower expenses, a lower environmental footprint and higher service quality. In practice, these programs use algorithms such as Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will explain the inner working of several construction heuristics and metaheurstics using simple examples. I 'll demonstrate them on several use cases with my optimization framework Drools Planner. When you leave this session, you should be able to solve a planning problem, implement such algorithms yourself and reuse those algorithms from an existing optimization framework.",

    "summary": "Whether it’s employee rostering, task scheduling, vehicle routing, bin packing or another planning problem: all organizations try to optimize their limited resources under constraints. So why do most of them do such a poor job? Why do they continue to execute schedules with higher expenses, a higher environmental footprint and lower service quality? Because it’s computationally very difficult and humanly impossible to optimize these problems.\r\n\r\nDrools Planner optimizes planning problems for normal Java programmers. It implements a series of optimization algorithms which can optimize any planning problem. The input and output are plain old java beans (POJO’s), constraints can be expressed in OO manner as Drools Expert rules or plain old Java and there's a complete reference manual and many examples.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will explain the nature of planning problems, go through an entire Drools Planner example, show some demo’s and compare results.",

Then we'll switch gears into proper application development, leaning on the Griffon framework for the heavy lifting. Adding database and network access requirements (via REST interfaces for example) is quite straight forward thanks to the good number of plugins supported by the framework. The workshop assumes attendees have a fair knowledge of desktop application development (whether it's Swing, SWT and/or JavaFX).",

    "summary": "Enterprise OSGi 4.2 standardized the use of a number of component models for developing Enterprise OSGi applications: Servlet, JSP, Blueprint, and JPA. Implementations of these specifications have since become available in many open source projects and products such as Apache Aries, Eclipse Gemini/Virgo, GlassFish, and WebSphere Application Server. Looking at a number of these environments, it's clear that when it comes to assembly and deployment there's still something missing, namely something to represent a collection of bundles (e.g. an Application). Hence the Subsystems specification is being created for the Enterprise OSGi 5.0 specification.\r\nSubsystems is an OSGi specification which standardizes artifacts representing collections of bundles. This presentation will describe how Subsystems can be used for development and deployment of bundle collections with different isolation semantics, to address the application, composite and feature use cases seen in the OSGi community today.",

You will build a functioning recommendation engine that can handle huge amounts of data. No prior Hadoop knowledge is required, Java and a bit of Scala will help.\r\n\r\nThe amount of data we process is increasing rapidly and more and more organizations are using Hadoop in order to scale their processing beyond the limits of a single machine. When starting with Hadoop, you will quickly find out that writing Hadoop MapReduce jobs in Java is time-consuming, verbose, invasive, and involves lots of boilerplate code. Also, using low level MapReduce is not always a natural fit to problem domains. Scala to the rescue! The Scoobi library allows you to interact with Hadoop by using Scala's list manipulation constructs.\r\n\r\nSession outline:\r\n- Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce\r\n- A look at a Java product recommender\r\n- Hacking a better one: Scala and Scoobi",

This problem has recently gotten much, much worse. Due to the rise of multi-core processors, massive increases in main memory and enhancements to other major hardware components (e.g. SSD) means that the JVM is now distant from utilising that hardware, causing some major performance and scalability issues!\r\n\r\nMartijn Verburg and Kirk Pepperdine will take you through the complexities of where Java meets the machine and loses. They'll give up some of their hard won insights on how to work around these issues so that you can plan to avoid termination, unlike some of the poor souls that ran into the T-800...",

The talk will not only show how to \"translate\" the code, but most importantly, how to take advantage of all the new features of Akka & Spray applications in Scala. Throughout the talk, there will be plenty of code examples, no bullet points and plenty of inspiration.\r\n\r\nJan will show how to make most of your Spring expertise and how to take it up a notch and build asynchronous and scalable applications.",

    "title": "Leveraging Server-Side to Accelerate Java Development",
    "summary": "When changing the core of a large-scale application, or a broadly used library, it is often necessary to see the effects of the change in the context of the whole application or many library clients. It is often unfeasible to have all the dependant projects accessible on the developer's machine, and much less to have them all opened in the developer's IDE. Server-side can be leveraged to make the developer's productivity higher in such case. Queries like find usages can be easily run on the server. The usual server-side static code analysis can be greatly improved by leveraging NetBeans' declarative way to describe custom refactorings. Domain specific antipatterns can be defined using a Java-like DSL and server-side leveraged to find out which client code is violating them. In this talk, we will demonstrate both how to use such server-side support and how to setup the server side using the Hudson continuous integration server.",

It includes Google Web Toolkit (GWT) to provide best of the Java based UI development - both of the server and client-side. The presentation describes the new features and design decisions and explains the implications of including GWT.\r\n\r\nThe first goal for Vaadin 7 is to give more freedom to use underlying technologies with ease. We'll show through examples on how to utilize new API:s. The second goal is to embrace the extensibility of the framework with new APIs for adding features. Final goal of the release is to clean up the API. We show what have been changed, how the changes may break your application and give advice on how to upgrade to Vaadin 7.",

These features take boilerplate busting to the next level, including call-site extension methods, complete property support including change listeners and bound properties.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that don't know lombok, we'll cover the basics as well: instead of writing out common boilerplate such as getters, setters, toString, equals, and hashCode implementations, you can just use a lombok annotation. Lombok hooks into your compiler and IDE so that their interpretation of your source includes these methods, while you never actually see any of them in your editor. While most IDEs offer a feature to generate the boilerplate, this is little help when reading the resulting code, and such code is much harder to maintain.",

    "summary": "Everyone tests the security of their application, but how safe is the build process that creates the application itself? Modern Java build tools automate the process of retrieving dependencies from public repositories like Maven Central. While convenient, this unfortunately also opens the door for malicious code-injection attacks during the build process. These so-called cross-build injection (XBI) attacks are not very well known, but their impact can be devastating. Attacks can be countered both by improving organizational processes and by using cryptographic primitives to ensure dependencies are safe. This session shows what you can do to secure your builds, by presenting XBI attack vectors along with the appropriate countermeasures.",

Even though Actor model is a simple and revolutionary idea it becomes hard for programmers to see practical benefits and usage. One possible solution to this problem is to evaluate the new paradigm in terms of old paradigm. In this presentation we will take a working Spring based web application and gradually implement it using actors. We will be skeptical and suspicious of new ideas but at the same time we will be open minded. We will learn about actor based concurrency model using the knowledge of spring.",

I believe I am almost unique among programmers having strong skills with both databases and objects together. I have a passion for the elimination of duplication in design, code, data, and most of all – effort.\r\n\r\nI write software for a living. But since I enjoy creating things and solving problems, I also write software on my pastime. I am currently working on scala-webmachine (restful resource framework). In past I worked on other open source projects like Panopticode, scala-inline and autotest4j. When I am not working on projects I play with functional programming and DSL. \r\n\r\nCurrently writing a book on Scala programming language called “Scala in Action” from Manning publication.\"",

    "summary": "Have you looked into Scala? Scala is a new object-functional JVM language. And it happens to be my favorite programming language. If you are interested in Scala, how you are planning to learn Scala?\r\nYou probably are going to pick up a book or two and follow through some examples. And hopefully some point down the line you will learn the language, its syntax and if you get excited enough maybe build large applications using it. But what if I tell you that there is a better path to enlightenment in order to learn Scala?\r\nScala Koans, a set of test cases that will teach you Scala language. The Scala koans are very much influenced by Ruby Koans (http://www.rubykoans.com/) and will help the audience learn the language, syntax and the structure of the language through test cases. It will also teach the functional programming and object oriented features of the language. Since learning is guided by failing tests it allows developers to think and play with the language while they are learning.",

Since 1998 he has been living almost exclusively in the Java world where he could build deep expertise in technologies for enterprise applications like AspectJ, Spring, Eclipse RCP and OSGi. Soon after he was infected by Scala he started the ScalaModules project, a Scala-based DSL for OSGi, and became a committer to various Scala open source projects like Akka. Heiko regularly shares his expertise in articles and talks and is the main author of the German Scala book \"Durchstarten mit Scala\".",

This provides a framework where you can work in a variety of styles and mix the constructs from different styles. Functional programming makes it easy to build interesting things from simple parts (functions), and object-oriented programming makes it easy to adopt and extend complex systems using inheritance, classes, and so on.\r\nThis presentation will use Scala programming language and demonstrate the power you get when you combine them together.",

Akka is using latest jsr-166 fork-join pool and can process up to 50 million messages per second in a single JVM. Performing detailed tracing in production of Akka actor based systems involves several challenges. Collection of data must be done with minimal impact of the application. Aggregated statistics is produced from huge amount of data and presented in a meaningful user interface. The monitoring solution itself is based on Akka, and that has been a key enabler to a performant and stable system. Also, using Scala, AspectJ, MongoDB and Play 2.0 framework has been important for the Typesafe Console.",

The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction and Akka is here to change that. \r\n\r\nAkka is an, open source, unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the grid/cloud). With Akka this will be taken to a whole new level with its “Distributed by Design”. Akka provides location transparency by abstracting away both these tangents of scalability by turning them into an operations and configuration task. This gives the Akka runtime freedom to do adaptive automatic load-balancing, cluster rebalancing, replication and partitioning. \r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn what Akka is and how it can be used to solve hard scalability problems. Akka is available at http://akka.io (under Apache 2 license).",

Well, mutation testing can do that.\r\n\r\nMutation testing changes your source code, and then checks whether your unit tests can detect it. If they do, everything is fine, but if they don't, something may be wrong. Maybe there's a path through your code you haven't thought about, and you should to write an extra unit test? Maybe there's a bug, and you have to change your source code. And sometimes you have too much source code, and you can delete a few lines.\r\n\r\nThis talk first explains the basic idea of mutation testing and its relation to other software quality techniques. Then it'll discuss the techniques used by mutation testing tools and give an overview over the tools currently available, with a closer look at PIT, a mutation testing tool for Java. Finally, I'll present my personal experiences and practices using an example, with some recommendations to get started.",

    "summary": "Design patterns in functional programming are computation models. When you use such a pattern in modeling your abstractions, you not only get an expressive domain model, you also get the ability to verify its correctness by defining properties that hold good in the computation. In this talk, I will present a few of such abstractions - Monoid, Semi-Group, Functor, Applicative etc. and how they help build domain models in real world applications. One of the great virtues that these patterns embody is that they stay behind your application domain model and yet offer the glue that help you compose larger abstractions out of smaller ones. So they help make your model expressive by removing boilerplate glue code out of your core application.",

    "summary": "When you model a domain you map the artifacts from the problem domain to the solution domain. The problem domain artifacts are the same irrespective of your solution domain. But the mapping process depends on your medium of modeling, the target platform, the programming language and the paradigms that it offers. Accordingly you need to orient your thought process so as to adapt to the language idioms that you have chosen for implementation. Recently I did a fun exercise in modeling the same problem domain on to 2 target languages - Scala, that offers a mix of OO and functional features and Clojure, that's much more functional and makes you think more in terms of functions and combinators. The idea is to share the thought process of this domain modeling exercise and demonstrate how even similar architectural patterns of the solution can map to entirely different paradigms in the  implementation model.",

Infinispan's open source data-grid provides potentially linear scalability for data access and a comprehensive events framework that can be leveraged in this type of architecture. In the first part of this session we will explore this combination of open source technologies, covering the fundamental principals of Data Grids and Websockets.

    "summary": "The idea of continuous delivery requires automated software testing in the first place. When it comes to integration testing with several interfaces and protocols (SOAP WebServices, JMS, Http, FTP, TCP/IP) the test automation can be very difficult. Interface partners must be simulated and the test data flow must be designed carefully. In addition to that tests must be reproducible as we want prove the interface conformity on our continuous software builds. The Citrus integration test framework gives us fully automated integration tests with huge protocol support and powerful validation capabilities (e.g. XML, JSON, SOAP, REST). The presentation gives an introduction to Citrus and handles complex testing scenarios with multiple interfaces at the same time. Finally we incorporate the Citrus tests into the continuous build and delivery process so tests get executed with each code change.",

In my presentation I discuss the 5-10 top test mistakes and bad habits from coding and procedural perspective. At the end you will notice that most part of the test frustration comes from our own misbehavior and that things can be improved. The points discussed are:\r\n1) Loosing brain: Avoid poor test code quality.\r\n2) Feedback gaps: Long running software builds are bad.\r\n3) Manual testing: Find test automation everywhere!\r\n4) Lost in documentation: Minimize academic papers on tests in prior to coding them.\r\n5) John Doe at the FooBar: Think of good test data not using the same values all the time.\r\n\r\nI tried to outline my thoughts in more detail in an addendum attached.",

    "summary": "Maqetta (www.maqetta.org) is an opensource authoring tool built with HTML5 technologies. It allows to visually (i.e. drag/drop) develop HTML5 user interfaces in the browser, targeting both the desktop and mobile platforms. Designed with the UI Designer-Developer relationship in mind, it promotes a collaborative workflow approach, avoiding intrusive code interaction. In this interactive presentation, I will present the major features of Maqetta through the development of a mobile application, including the UI development advanced capabilities (including wireframe mockup, custom theme) and the team collaboration features (built-in review/comment mechanism, UI  export to dev environment).",

Versions aren't sexy, but they're very important in modern software development: they are the primary way to evolve software and communicate the features, compatibility and stability of our artifacts.\r\n\r\nOSGi is one of very few environments where versions are pervasively and consistently applied, and is therefore an ideal environment for growing and maintaining large systems. And yet, even many OSGi developers still don't use versions properly. Why??\r\n\r\nBecause proper versioning is hard, and existing tools force us to manually maintain them. The number of versions quickly exceeds the capacity of any human brain. But it needn't be this way: the problem is eminently manageable with tools. Developers should never have to remember to manually bump a version or think about a range.\r\n\r\nI will describe the correct use of versions in OSGi (and elsewhere) and demo tools that automate version management, so that large software projects can be evolved in a truly modular way.",

By applying an architecture using design patterns and proven best practices we avoid these problems.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the need for a good architecture becomes ever so important. In search of a good methodology we discovered that, not surprisingly, the needs in various environments are the same, and can be tackled in the same way. Whether it's Android, HTML 5/CSS 3/JavaScript, iOS and maybe even other mobile platforms, the main building blocks of this architecture might always come back. The gains of a common architecture is that the principals behind it only need to be explained once, and can be applied on different platforms.\r\n\r\nThe main topics for this talk are:\r\n\r\n- Architecture: an overview\r\n- Back-end integration\r\n- Dealing with data\r\n- Object dependencies\r\n- GUI architecture",

Despite it is not a new idea, only in recent years functional programming is gaining more traction, mostly because it makes easier the development of heavily parallel programs. Nevertheless there's a third paradigm that, especially for some specific categories of problems, represents the most natural, flexible and maintainable solution: declarative programming. After a brief introduction to declarative programming and rule engines, showing how they work and in which circumstances they should be used, the talk will illustrate how these concepts have been implemented in Drools and which tools the Drools ecosystems provides making it a complete and effective Business Logic Integration Platform.",

Akka (http://akka.io) is an advanced implementation of this model on the JVM, offering Java and Scala APIs. With version 2.0 we introduced mandatory parental supervision, an addition over other actor implementations which aims at fostering fault-tolerant designs from the beginning.\r\nThe first part of this talk will introduce actor hierarchies and show design patterns which can be applied when breaking down a task to model it onto an actor system. Most of these patterns are not specific to Akka but applicable to any implementation of the actor model.\r\nThe second part of this talk introduces the Akka TestKit, which supports a wide range of testing approaches from white-box to black-box, detailing strengths and weaknesses of the different levels at which tests can be conducted. It also covers the relation between the design patterns of part one and their associated testing strategies.",

After an overview of key features of Groovy 1.8, we'll dive through the new features of Groovy 2.0.\r\n\r\nLots of Groovy users are using the language as a Java scripting language. Not all need the dynamic capabilities, nor do they need all the library improvements provided by Groovy. For the latter, Groovy becomes more modular with smaller core modules that you can compose. For the former, Groovy 2.0 adds static type checking, allowing you to ensure the correctness of your code before it ships and quickly spot early errors at compile time. \r\n\r\nAlso not everybody needs dynamic features at all times: With static compilation, Groovy 2.0 generates fast bytecode like Java and shields key parts of your code base from possible interferences of dynamic features. But when you need fast and performant dynamic logic, Groovy 2.0 also features the integration of the JDK 7 \"invoke dynamic\" support.",

It’s also about being able to persist your objects in NoSQL databases and mapping your objects to XML and to JSON for on disk storage or for use in RESTful web services.  The persistence needs of applications are evolving from predominantly relational to a mixture of heterogeneous data sources.  In response to these needs EclipseLink, the Java Persistence API 2.0 and 2.1 reference implementation, is making support for NoSQL and other non-relational databases a first class citizen. In this session we’ll introduce EclipseLink JPA’s support for NoSQL and other non-relational databases and show through examples how easy it is to embrace polyglot persistence in your Java applications.",

It explains how to create bundles and define package imports/exports including semantic versioning. It will discuss services; the most important concept for achieving modularity.

Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) –the result of combining several proven best practices- emerged as an architectural pattern to address these problems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Allard will explain how CQRS based architectures address not only concurrency and scalability problems, but also how this pattern supports the developers’ everlasting battle against complexity. He will also introduce the Axon Framework, a (Java) framework that helps in the implementation of a CQRS based architecture. The outcome of the session will result in insight in both the opportunities and threats in applying CQRS, based on very practical and down-to-earth scenarios.",

For the last decade, he has been developing and designing enterprise applications for both large-scale and smaller projects. His focus has always been on clean application design, maintainability and testing. The training of co-developers is a very important part thereof. \r\nAllard has given several trainings in the areas of test driven development, application design and clean coding. He strongly believes that good craftsmanship can only be achieved through continuous and intensive exchange of experience with others.\r\nThe last years, he has been investigating and applying CQRS to a number of projects. As a result, he founded the Axon Framework, an open source Java framework that helps developers create scalable and extensible applications by providing the building blocks that CQRS based infrastructures typically require. Axon has an active and growing community and has already been used to successfully realize several projects around the world.",

    "summary": "A modular runtime brings a lot of benefit when deploying applications in the cloud; zero downtime deployments (without the need of a cluster), small deployments, versioning etc. We use OSGi to modularize applications, but how do we deploy them to the cloud? You end up with a large set of small OSGi bundles. If you would package all those bundles together before deployment we lose the power of modular deployments.\r\n\r\nApache ACE is a provisioning server that helps you deploy modular applications to the cloud, private servers, desktops or even embedded and mobile devices. You can start up new cloud nodes (e.g. on Amazon EC2) from ACE and provision bundles to them. Updates to bundles can automatically be provisioned to servers, even to hundreds of servers or devices. ACE also keeps track of all changes over time and allows you to analyze the impact of changes to components quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will show how ACE can be used to deploy modular applications to the cloud.",

We will discuss different blend modes and the things that can be achieved by combining them. Lastly we will look at animations and, together with what we’re learnt so far, create a jaw dropping UI.\r\n\r\nIt’s all about making a lasting impression.",

    "summary": "Fact: your application has bugs -- and this is because *every* application has bugs. Our collective challenge is to find these bugs before our customers find them. We need to use and abuse our applications as our customers will. We need end-to-end, automated integration tests that behave and misbehave like our customers. \r\n\r\nHow best to write and automate these tests? Domain-specific languages (DSLs)! Using a DSL, you can easily convert use cases into positive and negative tests, automate the tests, express the tests in easy-to-read narrative form, and write new tests almost as fast as you can conceive of them. Isn't that worth looking into?\r\n\r\nWe'll cover some common-sense approaches to both DSL inception and DSL implementation. By following a few fundamental principles, you can have your own DSL that works across applications and -- with the right approach -- works inside your applications as well. Doesn't that sound like something to improve your quality of (work) life?",

We will show how the Activiti Process Engine can be perfectly integrated in Java EE 6, how CDI can be used to offer declarative, contextual process management and how the process engine can be a first class citizen in the Java EE container with a JBoss AS 7 integration. In the talk we demonstrate and discuss a working example application using JSF, CDI, EJB and of course Activiti and demonstrate in-container-testability using the JBoss Arquillian framework.

Everyone have seen (or have written himself!) tests, which are hard to understand, hard to maintain, and do not verify anything really important (or maybe they do, but it is too hard to deduce)! Some tests are simply a burden.\r\n\r\nDuring the talk I plan to present many examples of imperfect tests and show how to improve them. I will discuss typical issues related to writing tests and present techniques which can save our code like parametrized tests, custom asserts, test data builders. The talk is technical, full of useful hints & tips & tricks & dos and & dont's. It also presents few tools (that are not so commonly used). All code examples discussed during the talk are taken from real code. The talk is aimed at novice and senior developers.",

With jclouds, it's easy to migrate your application from one cloud to another without code changes, support multiple clouds from within your application, and much more.\r\n\r\njclouds is an open source library for JVM languages providing a consistent interface to a wide array of cloud providers and APIs, including EC2, Rackspace, vCloud, OpenStack, CloudStack and many more. Its mature API greatly simplifies the work of supporting multiple clouds, giving you a stable interface to work with regardless of the underlying provider or API.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an introduction to using jclouds, using the Jenkins jclouds plugin and Apache Whirr to demonstrate its power and ease of use. After attending this talk, you'll be able to get hit the ground running with your own cloud-independent application using jclouds.",

    "summary": "Creating a social layer like Google+ doesn't just mean building a mobile application or web site  - it means developing a platform for others to build on. Drawing from over a decade of engineering web APIS, this talk will cover how Google engineered our next generation APIs for discovery, how Google+ makes use of REST, how to build client libraries to make those APIs accessible, and how to make implementation as simple as drop-and-go with social plugins. The principles will be demonstrated with real code as we define and develop a new social plugin and apply the lessons we have learned.",

In this talk we define what is defined by the term “memory leak” in garbage collected languages and also classify the most common and/or the trickiest to handle types of memory leaks.\r\n\r\nWe start by defining the term “memory leak” as it is being used in the Java world. We also briefly compare it to the leaks in the C language. We will then discuss different types of memory leaks that can be encountered in any Java application. We will illustrate every type of the leak with some obvious examples, but also demonstrate the more unusual/obscure ones. For every type of memory leak, we also give hints on how to remedy them.\r\n\r\nTypes of memory leaks discussed in the talk:\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap Space\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: nativeGetNewTLA\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded",

How to track objects’ creation and disposal events? Bytecode instrumentation and the classes that cannot be instrumented. Using JVMTI object tags to elegantly encode a lot of useful information. A problem of locking and overhead.\r\nProblem 2. How to conduct graph analysis in a memory scarce environment. The problems of already existing libraries and APIs and why we ended up implementing the basic graph algorithm one more time ourselves.\r\nProblem 3.

Whether you are a developer or an architect, many questions come to mind when faced with the decision of where your data should be stored and how it should be managed. The following are some of these questions: What does the rise of all these NoSQL technologies mean to my enterprise? What is NoSQL to begin with? Does it mean \"No SQL\"? Could this be just another fad? Is it a good idea to bet the future of my enterprise on these new exotic technologies and simply abandon proven mature RDBMS? How scalable is scalable? Assuming that I am sold, how do I choose the one that fit my needs best? Is there a middle ground somewhere? What is this Polyglot Persistence I hear about? The answers to these questions and more is the subject of this talk along with a survey of the most popular of NoSQL technologies. Be there or be square.",

Xtext lets you reuse Java compatible language concepts such as expressions, type references and annotations anywhere in your DSL. You only need to describe the grammar and a mapping to Java. From that you get a statically typed language with its own compiler and top notch Eclipse integration.\r\n\r\nTo inspire your imagination we’ve developed 7 useful yet different DSLs. These languages include a Gradle-like language to describe builds, an Http routing DSL similar to the one from play! and a fun and interactive reimplementation of Logo (do you remember?). All of them support debugging and tight integration with Eclipse's Java IDE out of the box. And the best is that it actually didn’t take 7 weeks to do that.\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn the basic steps needed to implement a DSL for the JVM. After that, you will get a brief overlook of what else is possible. Language development with Xtext is interesting, fun, and creative!",

Scala is a object-functional language that improves on Java in several areas. Java EE 7 is the enterprise edition \"taking it to the clouds\" with virtualisation. I will show how to build a Scala application with ScalaFX framework, a domain specific language, and tie it to application that stores data to the cloud. I will discuss the limitations of the technologies I chose to write the application. I will also discuss the hot issue of the moment, should I stick with Spring Framework or dump it to go with the Java EE specification.",

Putting a JSF application to work, setting up persistence or enabling restful web services are not trivial tasks.  \r\nJBoss Forge is a versatile and lean development environment entirely written in Java and making smart use of CDI. Its purpose is to offer you the possibility of incrementally working in new functionality into existing Java projects. It is a command-line oriented tool, so creating entities or scaffolding a user interface is just a matter of issuing a few commands. \r\nBut what if your task cannot be done by Forge? No worries, as Forge operates by means of plug-ins, the answer is simply to look for an appropriate plugin or create it yourself if one is not available. \r\nFinally, Forge can also be integrated in graphical IDE's opening up all its power to users of common platforms such as Eclipse.\r\nCome to this session if you want to see this powerful tool live in action!",

Unfortunately there is no official standard for this. In this (methodology) conference talk I would like to present a practical example of how we create and version webservices at Reggefiber. \r\nFirst, I will show our choices\r\n* the version number is added to the namespace, WSDL and XSD filename, package name, WAR name and endpoint\r\n* every change results in a new version number (making it not backwards compatible)\r\n* the (dis)advantages of the above choices will be discussed in the last part of the presentation\r\nNext, I will guide the audience through an example and show how the above choices are handled in\r\n* documenting our webservices\r\n* publishing our webservice definitions\r\n* generating OXM classes and publishing them in our Maven repository (Nexus)\r\n* implementing webservices\r\n* building WARs\r\n* deploying our applications",

It turns out that in case of complex domain models we usually run into interesting performance issues.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing basic mappings of collections and sub-object last year, this time we focus on advanced parameters for collections, inheritance hierarchies, and HQL. In this puzzle-driven talk, we explain common mistakes or omissions related to usage of advanced attributes in mappings of complex structures like collections or inheritance trees. Additionally, we show performance impact of various constructs in HQL-based or Criteria-based queries. The presented real code examples illustrate how the anti-patterns can decrease performance and how to implement the mappings to speed up execution times.",

While comparing the results, we discuss the capabilities of both tools and explain the mechanisms behind the tools together with their strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we also present a short summary of security issues found automatically in popular libraries, including Spring, Struts, and others.",

The above combined let us build a simple robot remotely controlled with an Android phone.\r\n\r\nThe talk is going to have a theoretical part, during which I would like to introduce the basics of leJOS and Android development, and give a brief overview of the remote control application and the robot software. This is then going to be followed with a live demo showing the robot in action.",

Developers now shun it at their peril, but what happens as ever-more complex applications are implemented in JavaScript? They quickly become unmaintainable.\r\nWe implemented one application that peaked at 60,000 lines of JavaScript. During development, we began investing in reusing Java/server-side patterns in JavaScript. The result is H-UBU, an injection framework for JavaScript. H-UBU allows JavaScript applications to be developed with self-defined, autonomous and testable components. Components interact with one another using injected references or events. Thanks to H-UBU, we have been able to develop and maintain large JavaScript applications. We have code that scales better, and developers who can reuse the concepts promoted by CDI and other Java component models.\r\nThis talk introduces H-UBU, and explains how you can use this simple injection framework to successfully build sophisticated JavaScript applications.",

All of this will be explained using live coding.  Some knowledge of Scala and functional programming is assumed.",

    "summary": "Since 2011, the mobile applications market has seen the rise of web-based applications. \r\nHowever, web standards are not universally supported or rendered the same way from one platform to another. So, a company adopting a web-oriented strategy to develop cross-platform applications must make numerous crucial choices in terms of JS libraries & CSS properties. In addition, a cross-platform design is almost impossible to achieve. For these reasons, we have created a framework, named Funamble. It is an object-oriented JS library based on Mootools and jQuery enabling us to build rich and flexible cross-platform mobile applications, like games or animations. It dynamically creates, adapts and drives the application UI without requiring a hard-coded, CSS-based “responsive” design. To achieve this, Funamble manages an ultra-thin subset of HTML / CSS and requires only one version of the UI design. This talk presents Funamble and details FishDish implementation, an action game deployed on Android & iOS marketplaces.",

    "summary": "Pushing information is a decoupled and performance effective way to ensure interested parties have the most recent information ASAP.\r\n\r\nThis session looks at reasons and technology for pushing information at various points in an enterprise architecture. Databases can push to the middle tier - as a result of data manipulation - the middle tier pushes to the browser - triggered by email, chat, JMS message or CEP (Complex Event Processing) event and one client can push to another. The link with Event Driven Architecture is explored as well as mobile applications.\r\n\r\nHTTP Channels and Web Sockets are introduced, push in JEE 7 is discussed as well as AJAX based background push, push from the database. We'll look at what to send in an event and how to present the push signal to the end user. This session will explain how push is good for performance and (decoupled) architecture in general, it talks about upstream push and real time challenges. Of course this session includes many interesting demos.",

The agility and short time to market so desired can be brought about by introducing configuration-at-runtime facilities into applications - that allow changing behavior and look & feel without the need for software re-development and rollout. Additionally, SaaS applications can be tuned to specific user groups using customization features per internal user group or external customer. This session demonstrates how such agility can be built into JavaServer Faces applications. Demos include: fine grained permissions, add/change/hide fields, page reorganization, boiler plate text editing and more.\r\n\r\nThe key objectives of this session: explain how customization of (SaaS) applications are similar & desired, discuss how functionality & look/feel can be made configurable at run time and show how run time manipulation of the JSF UIComponent tree opens many options for customization",

Most database can handle complex aggregations and data analysis, calculations and bulk manipulation, and some offer advanced features like flashback, change notification, zero-down time upgrades and fine grained security and auditing. At the same time, NoSQL style grid based cache facilities may (partially) replace or complement traditional relational databases. This session reviews what Java applications can and should make databases do - and what not. It also demonstrates how the database can best be accessed - and how the database can push information the other way to the application.The objectives for this session: make the audience better appreciate what modern database can do, illustrate how a multi-tier application can be designed - taking the database into account as tier and demonstrate some useful Java/Database interaction patterns-leveraging each for its specific strength.",

How do you understand what the customer wants - and how does he get his idea across? How do you communicate the requirements to all colleagues participating in development and testing? By the way, documentation is needed as well! And automated acceptance testing would be great! We want to introduce Behaviour Driven Development with Cucumber to you as a possible answer to all these questions.\r\nWith the help of to little stories from real world projects we want to show you how the methodology of Specification By Example helps yout to specify the right system. Finally we demonstrate how to transform this specifiaction into operational software with Cucumber. It is a tool that took the Ruby community by storm and is also availabe for Java as well. We transform scenarios described in natural language into automated acceptance tests and share our practical experiences an pitfalls we identified.",

    "summary": "Whether you like it or loath it, Java the language and Java the platform have set the standard for enterprise computing for over a decade and don't look like giving up that top spot for a while yet. However, we continue to hear complaints about the complexity of developing applications with JEE. Various frameworks sprang up over the years to try to simplify the lives of JEE developers (Seam,Spring,...) and with the advent of Java Enterprise Edition 6, we are starting to see a renaissance. So the question deserved to be asked : is JEE still as painful as it was rumored to be ?\r\n\r\nTherefore, we'll look at what has happened in the last few years that have already increased the productivity of enterprise Java development, such as CDI. We'll illustrate some of this with the new release of the JBoss  AS7, which is a full EE6 compliant application server and yet is fast, modular and lightweight. And also mention some Open Source advancement that may make their way into the standards.",

Currently, each ALM platform vendor predetermines a list of tools with which its ALM platform connects. Unfortunately, connecting new tools often requires integration effort. The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration specification (OSLC) is changing the game. If a tool provides an API compliant with the OSLC specification, it will then seamlessly integrate with OSLC-compliant ALM platforms. Few commercial ALM platforms currently implement the OSLC specifications, but a growing number of tools are now proposing OSLC compliant API.\r\nAfter a presentation of the current ALM platforms situation, a review of ALM tools is presented. Subsequently, a several queries where data from different tools are aggregated are used to demonstrate the power of OSLC. Finally, the talk concludes on the perspective and challenges of ALM platforms of the future.",

Recent\r\nversions have introduced a new API: the Cassandra Query Language (CQL). That\r\nCQL sounds a lot like SQL is no accident, CQL is an SQL-alike query language.\r\nThis talk will cover the motivation behind CQL and in particular behind its\r\nlast incarnation dubbed CQL3. Through examples, we will present the language\r\nand explain a number of data modeling principle in Cassandra.",

      "speakerBio": "Josh Suereth is a Senior Software Engineer at Typesafe and the author of \"Scala In Depth\". He has been a Scala enthusiast ever since he came to know this beautiful language in 2007. He started his professional career as a software developer in 2004, cutting his teeth with C++, STL and Boost.  Around the same time, Java fever was spreading and his interest was migrating to web-hosted distributed Java-delivered solutions to aide health departments discover the outbreaks of disease.  Everything from EJB to Hibernate/Spring and even some Applets.  He introduced Scala into his company code base first in 2007 and soon after he was infected by Scala fever, contributing to the Scala IDE, maven-scala-plugin and Scala itself. In 2009 he began writing the book \"Scala In Depth\" which provides practical support for using Scala in every day applications.   Today, Josh is the author of several open source scala projects, including the scala automated resource management library, the PGP sbt plugin, as well as contributing to key components in the Scala ecosystem, like the maven-scala-plugin.  His current work at Typesafe Inc. has him doing anything from building MSIs to profiling performance issues.  Josh regularly shares his expertise in articles and talks.",

However whereas an application server offers technical services only, a wiki platform offers higher level services such as content management, rendering, storage, WYSIWYGeditor, user management, and a lot more.\r\n\r\nNot only are these services offered, you can develop using them in your traditional IDE or in the runtime, directly in wiki pages. This allows developing web applications extremely quickly, collaboratively and with a fast turnaround time, which is perfect for adhoc web application development.",

    "summary": "To search for a set of objects or data that satisfy some complex criteria, spanning over many classes and relationships, Hibernate developers use HQL queries. However, it is a well-known problem that complex HQL queries, with many joins across class hierarchies, may perform very poorly, especially if executed on large databases. In such cases, Hibernate developers often escape to native SQL, giving up the object perspective and compactness of queries. Complex SQL queries are, however, cumbersome and difficult to maintain. FastOQL solves this problem by producing optimal SQL queries with a minimal number of joins from object queries. FastOQL is a Java library that compiles OQL (Object Query Language) queries into efficient SQL queries. It is designed to work with Hibernate, as an alternative to its HQL, to address its performance and scalability problems. If the domain model has inheritance hierarchies and/or collections mapped to association tables, FastOQL can bring substantial performance benefits.",

Sometimes attacks are very sophisticated but most of the time somebody just left the door open. \r\n\r\nBut there are many things developers can do to prevent at least some of these attacks. This presentation will give a live demo to show how hackers can abuse common attacks like Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery and Session Hijacking to break their way in. \r\n\r\nAfter that I will show how you can use OWASP ZAP proxy to test you own websites to find security vulnerabilities. This Open Source tool is available free of charge and can easily be configured to automatically report security holes in your website. \r\n\r\nLast but not least this presentation shows how you must protect your passwords once they have been lost.",

Our source code changes. It is always in the PROCESS.This process we call Natural Order of Refactoring – a mental model, which help to answer most critical questions: What stage my source code is really on? Which refactoring technique causes most valuable change? How to refactor step by step in small chunks? Major benefits are:1:programming and refactoring are no more seen as two separate skills or techniques; these are two sides of the same coin – sides of the NOR process;2:code development is controlled by well-defined process;3:a developer has clear criteria how to move his solution from one process stage to the next one",

EclipseLink is well known as an object-relational mapping framework and as the JPA 2.0 reference implementation in Java EE 6, but it continues to evolve and now provides a comprehensive set of data services for Java developers building enterprise and cloud applications in Java EE and SE.  In this session we’ll dive into these new services and build an application that goes from mobile device to back end storage leveraging EclipseLink both in the back end for data persistence and on the front end for JSON over REST to support HTML5 clients.",

    "summary": "Static is the new dynamic. With the ever increasing capabilities of HTML5-based browsers, we can give the server a rest and put security problems behind us by publishing static HTML5 documents and shifting the dynamic behavior to the client. Not only does that let you blog out of static hosting sites like GitHub pages, it also means you can put more processing power into the author tools.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll be introduced to Awestruct, a Ruby-based tool for building and publishing static websites. You'll discover how you can leverage a wide range of lightweight markup languages such as HAML, Textile, Markdown, SASS and CoffeeScript to keep your source terse and DRY. We'll use Awestruct's extension pipeline to setup a blog, add comments to your site or add analytic tracking scripts to your pages, then build and publish the site to github pages in a single command. Just because the pages are static doesn't mean they can't be dynamic too.",

    "summary": "Every Java EE developer is familiar with WAR files and Servlets, and most are familiar with Spring and dependency injection. Those who have used these two technologies together are also painfully aware of how hard it can be to manage the class path and class loaders of their application as they add more library JARs.\r\n\r\nOSGi offers the perfect modularity solution for this “class path hell”, but few developers are aware that you can use WARs and dependency injection within an OSGi framework.\r\n\r\nMoving Java EE applications to an OSGi stack is as easy as possible. In this session we will discuss the basics of the OSGi modularity model, and demo the build tools, middleware, and architectural principles which can be used to turn a chunky WAR into a lean, mean, extensible OSGi web application ! \r\n\r\nWhilst his session is primarily aimed at enterprise developers new to OSGi, much of the content is equally applicable to OSGi development, and is recommended to anyone looking to brush up on their OSGi principles",

In this workshop, Trisha Gee from LMAX will show examples of how to use the Disruptor to share data between threads, and walk you through how to create your own application using the Disruptor.",

If you want to work with real talent that you can learn from, or even just enjoy coding with colleagues, you need to get involved in the hiring process.  You’re the only person who can say if the candidate is bright enough, experienced enough, and good enough for you to work with.\r\n\r\nRecruiting developers is tricky.  The best developers are often headhunted before they even write their CV; it’s very hard to figure out a person’s real technical ability before they start on the team; and many organisations drastically underestimate the importance of cultural fit.\r\n\r\nIn this session we’ll share our experiences in doubling the size of the development team, going from 12 developers to 24 in less than a year.  We’ll cover:\r\n - Places to look for good developers\r\n - How to attract them to your organisation\r\n - The interview process\r\n\r\nWe’ll give solid examples of things we’ve done to make our lives easier, and lessons we learnt the hard way.",

    "summary": "Vaadin is by now one of the most popular frameworks to build rich internet applications. Based on Google Webtoolkit it provides an easy way to build stunning web applications with java. \r\nIts simple component based Java API makes it easy to get in touch with, especially by neglecting the usual struggle with html-templates, cascading-stylesheets, hacking java script etc, which most java developers aren’t quite familiar with. Just pure java code which reminds a bit of programming swing, but this time the outcoming application is on the web with just a few clicks.\r\n\r\nBut this approach also has it pitfalls. Although it seems to be quite easy in the beginning, writing sustainable code relying on reusable components can get quite challenging as the code base grows over time. During this session we want to present you a way to get this done by applying dependency injection with Google Guice and an Google Guava Libraries in order to create an application based loosely coupled components.",

GWT on the other hand is an excellent tool for building fast Javascript apps in Java, but it is missing some key parts for building great mobile apps with it. The two open source projects mgwt and gwt-phonegap close this gap: mgwt provides mobile widgets, that look like native widgets for different platforms - gwt-phonegap enables GWT apps to use Phonegap. \r\nPutting these frameworks to work creates performant mobile apps that feel like native apps while being platform independent.",

Behind most of these REST APIs is a domain model; the wiring up of that REST API to the model typically involves lots of boilerplate and lots of testing.  Sometimes there is a separate resource model in front of the domain model.\r\n\r\nRestful Objects is a specification that describes how to expose any domain model - with or without a separate resource model - over REST. It documents a set of HTTP URL resources and the corresponding JSON representations that they support; and it fully supports the stuff that REST-heads care about: HATEOAS, media types, link rels, conneg, HTTP headers, response codes etc.\r\n\r\nRestful Objects isn't just a specification though: there are also two separate open source implementations, one for JVM, the other on .NET.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Dan will explain some of the ideas behind the spec, and will show how you can use it to REST-enable an app in a matter of minutes.",

Due to zero latency access provided for local data and the scalability offered by the possibility of going to a remote Data Grid, it's no wonder that this is one of the most demanded Infinispan patterns.

How did Torquebox come about? Why are we creating Ceylon? What is Escalante? What is Immutant? This and many other questions will be answered in this informal chat that will not only look into the motivations behind building middleware in other languages, but will also discuss the technological advances that have this expansion possible. During this presentation the audience will get invaluable feedback on the lessons learnt while developing with other languages, pitfalls of the different languages used, tips of learning new languages...etc, giving them first-hand advice that they will be able to apply in their work environments. Finally, the talk will finish with information on how join and contribute to the JBoss Polyglot Revolution!",

It will be split into 3 exercises: 1) Building a web application using JAX-RS - attendees will learn some of the new concepts in JAX-RS 2.0 and use them for building the web application (using pre-loaded code snippets) 2) Adding SSE and WebSocket support to the web application - attendees will learn how to extend the existing web application with bi-directional communication between the server and the client  3) Building a simple client - the attendees will learn the new JAX-RS 2.0 client api as well as the client-part of web socket and SSE support in Jersey.",

This session introduces JMS 2.0 (JSR 343), the first update in more than a decade and easily the longest-awaited component of the forthcoming Java EE 7 standard. The biggest new feature of JMS 2.0 is a new API that makes JMS much easier to use, especially in a Java EE application. JMS 2.0 also provides API features to support greater scalability as well as additional messaging features, changes to support PaaS and Saas deployment, and a long list of minor enhancements and clarifications. With JMS 2.0 entering its public draft review stage, now is an ideal time to find out more about it and give your views.",

Whatever your level of experience with Java, reflection, code generation or java bytecode, you are guaranteed to learn something!\r\n\r\nThis talk will be illustrated with examples in Java and in BiteScript.",

Programming languages such as Scala, Scheme and Ruby provide direct support for closures.  Closures (or lambda expressions) has now become one of the most sought after features of java 8. Through closures and related features Java 8 aims to support programming in a multicore environment.\r\n\r\nGiven that today multi-core hardware is default, it is critical to write code that parallelizes gracefully. While fork-and-join introduced in Java 7 is a step closer to extract the benefits of multi-core, it still faces hurdles related to boilerplate code. Closure is designed to eliminate the need for boilerplate code while working with parallel arrays.\r\n\r\nCome join us in hands on exploration of this sought after feature, its impact on multi-core programming and associated gains in performance!!",

    "summary": "Use an ORM like Hibernate with a complex schema? You’ve probably had issues scaling your application in production.    Mapping Objects to relational database tables means constantly assembling and disassembling object graphs.  As your schema scales in complexity, this constant activity becomes a significant drag on performance.  \r\n\r\nThis presentation introduces a new open source database - Akiban Server - built from the ground up as a pure-Java database to work efficiently with ORMs.    The core concept, Table Groups, stores related data together giving your applications a 1:1 mapping between objects and the way data is stored in your database.  This translates to dramatic improvements in performance.  Akiban bridges the RDBMS with more document-oriented databases while preserving the ability to run SQL.  \r\n\r\nSpecific examples of 10-100x performance improvements will be demonstrated and attendees will learn how they can start using Akiban in existing applications without a costly rewrite.",

That’s the reason why W3C Device Description Repositories (DDR) exist. Unlike most commercial or closed source products, OpenDDR is currently the most comprehensive open and free repository of device description available. One of the reasons, it also became the first choice for initial contribution to the upcoming Apache DeviceMap project, the next generation of free, Open Source Device Repository by the Apache Community.",

    "summary": "In this presentation we will cover the tooling support of Java EE applications. One of the challenges of Java EE development is managing your project within an IDE. Most Java EE books talk about the different Java EE packaging schemes but often leave the actual setup to the reader. Setting up a project in an IDE can be a daunting job - you have to configure dependencies as well as create deployment descriptors and get everything packaged correctly. In addition you have to tackle unit tests and integration tests execution. Complicating matters, you must minimize cycle times for the developer so that they don’t spend most of their day waiting on builds. In this presentation we will cover Java EE project support provided by the major IDEs.",

Fantom among few other languages has first class Units of Measurement support beside a better approach to date and time similar to Joda or JSR-310. While the latter may also help the IoT and Semantic Web, what really matters in M2M communication between Arduino, NAOs or your Coffee machine in the office while you're still at home is a unified precise exchange of measurement values, quantities and their units.\r\nThis session is going to demonstrate, how Future Mobile and Embedded Java versions may fit in with the Semantic Web, the Internet of Things and all these great innovative devices, avoiding to turn your Arduino Quadcopter into a Gimli Glider or having your NAO lost in Space like the Mars Rover;-D\r\nBased around the same innovations that fuelled Fantom's Unit support or projects like Unit-API we'll see, how this may work in future versions of Java.",

    "summary": "XACML, eXtensile Access Control Markup Language, is an emerging standard for the expression and evaluation of access control rules.  However, XACML has been largely aimed at large enterprise, and government IT problems, and it is not even clear how relevant XACML is to smaller developers. I will show how as the cloud becomes more and more ubiquitous,  the need to interact with XACML becomes more interesting. \r\n\r\nI will give a short overview of XACML, its history and its form.  Then we will cover the options you have as far as a XACML evaluation engine, of which there are several, both commercial as well as open source.  We will also talk about why it is even important to you, especially if you are not in large enterprise.\r\n\r\nI will then cover the work of a group working to build a free, open source, platform independent client api allowing even the smallest developer to be able to leverage XACML.",

    "summary": "Web-Services are everywhere. There is a plethora of WS stacks but most of them follow the paradigm of stubs generation. Handy as it may seem at the beginning, it can be redundant and cumbersome, e.g. one WSDL change triggers full recompilation and redeployment of the app. Problems also appear when many versions of the same service have to be maintained and the trickery that is then applied (postfixing class names, adding version numbers to packages, etc.) does not scale well, causes a rapid code-base growth and is clearly against \"best practices\". \r\n\r\nsoap-ws, authored by me, presents a different approach. It is a lightweight Java Web-Services stack that handles SOAP \"codelessly\" on a purely XML level. Using soap-ws enables generation, transmission and handling of SOAP messages without the usage of stubs. This session will cover some of the key drawbacks of using code-based SOAP stacks preventing people from following bad practices and offering handy tools to overcome above mentioned problems.",

In the presentation we will examine JavaFX animation support and the special effects capabilities of JavaFX. You’ll learn how to make a wizard UI exciting, use animation for business data and processes, and provide visual feedback. JavaFX’s animation and scene graph architecture open up new possibilities to make desktop applications exciting. We will look at how and where animation and special effects can be used to improve a desktop application.",

Similar in concept to BerkeleyDB, InnoDB, and Kyoto Cabinet DBM, the core use-case is applications that require an extremely fast, in-process storage engine for arbitrary data.   If you need to store, sort, and retrieve data PersistIt provides a pure-Java B-Tree with performance that rivals alternative native implementations.\r\n\r\nThis presentation focuses on using PersistIt for developing embedded applications, collecting log files, and an example of tracking application data using an in-process B-Tree on a mobile device.  Persistit works like a collection of Java Maps that are persistent, unlimited in size and capable of being shared among many threads. As a persistence product, Persistit offers all the benefits of fast Key-Value storage with the additional advantages of transactional durability and strong crash-recovery.",

    "summary": "Are you familiar with the automated dependency management like in Maven or any other fancy tool? You just define a bunch of artifacts and everything happens automagically. It does not, however, work like this for everybody. Dependency management in Eclipse RCP is a bit different. It is caused by two facts: on the one hand RCP is an OSGi environment which extends the Java dependency model, on the other hand there are some awkward RCP conventions. \r\n\r\nIn this session I will present how to fully automate dependency management in your Eclipse RCP app. I will show how to bridge the gap between Maven-like and RCP-like dependency management styles so that all Maven features can be seamlessly used without shivering. I am going to introduce p2-maven-plugin, authored by me, which does most of the hard work and serves as the missing piece in the integration between Maven, Tycho and RCP. The session will be concluded with the presentation of a fully-featured Eclipse RCP Ecosystem with Maven, Jenkins and Artifactory.",

It:\r\n\r\n• Covers tools that bootstrap project creation, freeing you from mucking around with Maven POM boilerplate\r\n* Generates a domain model and reverse-engineers JPA entities from it\r\n* Automatically creates the scaffolding for tests that run in a real Java EE container, launched from the IDE\r\n* Pushes it all to production on a public site\r\n\r\nUsing a variety of projects from the JBoss Community adhering to and building upon open standards, this presentation can create real enterprise apps in the time it takes other sessions to click through some slides. Let’s get building!",

What is it that we're looking for from our builds, and why have current approaches failed?\r\n\r\nThis BOF explores the following questions: What are trends in build tools?   What are the persistent problems?   How many of us are still dissatisfied with the build tools we use and how can we as participants in open source affect positive change? This presentation outlines the remaining problems with builds that are yet to solved and develops a framework to discuss how builds need to evolve going forward.",

But at the end of the day it all amounts to whether our end users are happy using our application. So how can keep the fail whale at bay and communicate with the stakeholders that the requirements are being met?\r\n\r\nDuring this talk we will see that the Arquillian ecosystem is way more than just integration testing. We will dive into the concept of ATDD and demonstrate how to build higher-level, end-to-end functional tests; we’ll be emulating user interactions using the Arquillian Drone extension together with the open source browser automation tool WebDriver. Reusable web testing components called Page Objects will make our tests cleaner and easier to maintain. Eventually we will sugar coat them with a Groovy DSL for Behaviour Driven Development to achieve testing nirvana.\r\n\r\nIf you care about quality of your software you definitely shouldn't miss this talk!

Starting from a sample application that uses an existing schema, participants will learn how to define Table Groups in an Akiban Server and improve the performance of problematic queries.   Participants will then learn how to query data from the Akiban Server as both documents using a JSON interface and as traditional rows in a relational database.  \r\n\r\nThe final hour of this Lab focuses on novel forms of query optimization and execution possible by Table Groups including fast reporting systems built atop operational databases that would be otherwise impossible without the benefit of Table Groups. Technologies used in this demonstration will include: Gradle, Eclipse, PersistIt, Hibernate, Spring, and Akiban Server.   Attendees should be a familiarity with SQL and Java web applications.",

Instead it defines high level, type safe, Java-like methods which allow a low level access to the JVM. With intrinsic functions (without the calling overhead) AL1 allows to \"enhance\" the JVM instruction set by offering unsigned integer arithmetic, safe arithmetic with overflow detection, alternate switch behavior, and so on. Although limited to the possibilities of the JVM AL1 promises a significant performance boost in specific areas without the need to switch to native implementations in C, which is especially useful when creating time critical frameworks and libraries.",

Integration of data and services between applications is not easy - and often requires adaptation from one system to another. Spring Integration also promotes loosely coupled, event-driven applications. Spring Batch is a batch processing framework - providing a simple, idiomatic way to crunch large amounts of data across in a sustainable way. Spring Batch even allows you to distribute processing across multiple machines in a cluster. Naturally, both of these frameworks play very nicely on top of Cloud Foundry, which lets you scale up and out as demand requires. In this talk, Josh Long introduces how to use Spring Batch and Spring Integration on Cloud Foundry, the open source PaaS from VMware.",

Today, more than 2M merchants and individuals use Square to process $6B annually. \r\n\r\nHow does Square deliver its trademark seamlessness? Simple. By routinely tackling daunting engineering challenges, shielding merchants and payers alike from the inherent complexities of payment processing.\r\n\r\nBob takes the audience on a tour of Square's stack, tracing the payment lifecycle from end to end. From magnetic stripe decoding to multi-homed data centers, Bob talks about lessons learned–what worked and what didn't–and the variety of technologies and open source frameworks concealed behind Square's simple façade.",

Finally, we’ll look at some OAuth2 APIs, both server-side and client-side, as an example of how this feels to an actual developer.",

Many commercial offerings indeed do not provide much more than this. \r\n\r\nThe Open Source project openHAB takes you much further than that: While running on small and cheap embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi, you can explore the world of Home Automation beyond the ordinary: Do a presence simulation by the push of a button; see live charts of your sensor data or adjust your irrigation schedule through Google calendar. \r\n\r\nopenHAB is meant for Java and OSGi geeks: It comes with a powerful, Xbase-based scripting language, which allows to easily define every kind of automation logic you could possibly have in mind. Through its modular OSGi architecture it is furthermore very easily extendible, so that it can connect to a multitude of different systems. \r\n\r\nThis session introduces the core concepts behind openHAB and demonstrates its advanced features in a live environment.",

The scientist rebutted the little old lady’s challenge with one of his own by asking what the tortoise was standing on. The little old lady’s sly reply was that it’s, “turtles all the way down.” So too is software architecture “turtles all the way down”. In this session, we cover a broad range of topics that challenge traditional practices of software architecture, examining what it takes to bring down the ivory tower, probing the paradoxical aspects of architecture’s goal, investigating the inextricable link between temporal decisions and structural flexibility, and exploring the roles of SOA, modularity, and software design principles and patterns. From the highest level applications and services to the code that exists in the bowels of the system, we explore architecture all the way down.",

And why do they matter? Whether you're new to Grails or an old hand, you'll find something of value in this session as we answer those questions and do some on-the-fly coding with varied Grails applications.\r\n\r\nWe will also look at both Grails and its plugin system in the context of the challenges of modern weba pplication development: cloud, NoSQL, and rich HTML5/js user interfaces. The basic plumbing of a web\r\napplication is only a small part of the whole development story now, so it's important to understand how the web framework can help you with the rest of the story. Again, you will see one or two sample applications as we explore what it looks like to develop a next-gen web app.",

    "summary": "Unit testing has become very popular with the rise of test-first software development. Most enterprise applications contain only a small portion of javascript code, almost always completely untested. We have seen a steady increase of javascript code and frameworks lately, but for most people it's still unclear how to (unit) test javascript, and most of all how to properly integrate these within your build environment next to other JUnit test cases. This presentation sheds some light on why javascript testing isn't very popular and how we can do something about it: how to test, what to test and how to integrate the whole thing.",

    "summary": "There are many implementations of JavaScript, meant to run either on the JVM or standalone as native code. Both approaches have their respective pros and cons. The soon-to-be open sourced Oracle Nashorn JavaScript project is based on the former approach. This presentation goes through the performance work that has gone on in Oracle’s Nashorn JavaScript project to date in order to make JavaScript-to-bytecode generation for execution on the JVM feasible. Aside from covering the Nashorn project itself, we show that the new invoke dynamic bytecode gets us part of the way there but may not quite be enough. What other tricks did the Nashorn project use? The presentation also discusses future directions for increased performance for dynamic languages on the JVM, covering proposed enhancements to both the JVM itself and to the bytecode compiler.",

With Greenfoot, kids from about 14 years upwards can create games and simulations in their first hour of contact, and quickly advance to interesting projects, including programming with Gamepads or the Kinect.

The first part dives deep into the misunderstood MDB/Connector API, reveals the inner simplicity and shows that with a slight twist radical new APIs can be created for distributed communication with expressive APIs that can rival JAX-RS. The second half of this session explores the budding concept of annotation reuse that blossomed independently in three specifications of Java EE 6; Bean Validation, CDI, and JAX-RS. A fundamental change aims to allow all specifications to adopt annotation reuse and extend that ability to developers.  An exciting glimpse into Java EE future, this session is a must for the bleeding edge enthusiast who loves to learn about and help shape the next big ideas before they hit the mainstream.",

However, not only is hardware getting smaller, servers are too. When your application server can run on pocket-sized £25 hardware it opens up some pretty cool possibilities for wearable computing - your server is literally lightweight. Not only can you have location-based services, you can have locatable servers.

    "summary": "In recent years, Scala has been gaining traction amongst Java developers. They choose Scala as a compelling alternative for the Java language itself. Amongst its many qualities, Scala runs on the JVM, introduces many interesting new language concepts, and makes it relatively easy to reuse existing Java code. None of the qualities are unique to Scala per se, but the fact remains that Scala is getting more and more interest, perhaps because of its type-safe nature (as opposed to the many dynamic language alternatives available on the JVM).\r\n\r\nIn this session, we introduce the Spring Scala project, aimed at making it easier to use Spring in Scala. Topics that we cover in this session are:\r\n* Configuring a Scala bean in Spring XML\r\n* Using Scala collections in Spring\r\n* Using Spring templates in Scala\r\n* Using Spring transactions\r\n* Functional Bean Configurations",
