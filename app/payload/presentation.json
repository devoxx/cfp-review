    "summary": "Every frontend developer knows the problem, the project you are working on requires a control that is not part of the standard library which raises the question...“How to do a custom control myself ?“ This talk will show you one way you could choose to create those custom controls in JavaFX. The internal structure of a JavaFX control with it‘s different parts like control, skin, behavior and css file will be explained. In addition the differences between a Java Swing component and a JavaFX control will be shown to give the audience with a Swing background an idea on how to convert existing Java Swing components to JavaFX controls. In addition it will be shown how one could get an existing design converted into a control. Therefore a small control will be created in a drawing program and afterwards be converted into code using different approaches like SVG to FXML, FXG to FXML and FXG to Java code.",

Each jar can contain a part of the war, the necessary java code needed for this war, the application server configuration files or the properties files used for internationalization.\r\nGoing further in the modularity/agility issue, the developers use a modifed version of tomcat's default class loader which offer hot reloading of their Java code. This also makes the reloading of extension points, fragments and templates possible.",

ElasticMQ is written in Scala; I will show examples where Scala was especially useful (e.g. the Cake Pattern). The libraries are also interesting: JGroups is a really easy way to implement replication; Squeryl offers type-safe SQL queries; and Netty is the way to build an asynchronous HTTP server. These will be short intros so that you feel encouraged to play at home. \r\n\r\nThe project is fully open-source. You are encouraged to fork at: https://github.com/adamw/elasticmq.",

      "speakerBio": "I am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, a company specialising in delivering customised software solutions (http://softwaremill.com, \"Extraordinary software as a standard\"), based on Java, Scala and JBoss technologies. I graduated from the University of Warsaw, receiving a Master's Degree in Computer Science. I am also involved in some open-source projects. Firstly as the founder and lead developer of Hibernate Envers, a Hibernate core module, which provides entity versioning/auditing capabilities; Envers is also included in JBoss AS since version 7.0.2. Secondly, as the founder of ElasticMQ, an SQS-compatible messaging server written in Scala.\r\n\r\nMoreover I work on several small projects around static analysis (using JSR 308 - Typestate Annotations/ Checkers Framework and FindBugs), and some CDI/Weld (not always portable) extensions, like autofactories or stackable security interceptors. I am also interested in improving the ways we use Dependency Injection, and some simple electronics using Arduino/RaspberryPi/Lego. When not working, I enjoy hiking in the mountains (summer), skiing (winter), playing tennis and since June 2010, spending time with my daughter.\r\n\r\nI have been a speaker at numerous conferences, including Devoxx, Jazoon, Confitura, JDD and Herbstcampus, as well as on Warsaw, Poznan and Riviera JUGs.\r\n\r\nMy blog: http://www.warski.org/blog",

We'll then compare PaaS APIs, provided resources and replacements, and discuss ways of separating your core portable business logic from your \"PaaS binding\". \r\n\r\nFinally, we'll look at \"live-from-IDE\" development, continuous integration and deployment options and touch on monitoring and application management in a multi-PaaS setup.",

But there are dozens of BDD tools for the JVM out there: how do you know what to use, and when? In this talk, we will look at the various BDD tools available for Java developers, both in Java and in other JVM languages. We will look at the pros and cons of the various tools, and learn which might be best suited for your team. Finally, you will discover the relationship between behavior driven development and automated acceptance testing, and why you probably need both.",

In fact, there are many ways to dramatically improve your code quality using a more functional style today! This talk will discuss how techniques such as functional programming, fluent APIs and other clean coding practices can make your code more concise, more readable, and much easier to maintain.

This presentation describes four real-world case studies of customers who weren’t ‘in the room’, how this compromised agile software development, how we communicated with the customer instead, and why agile software development techniques still had something to offer.\r\n\r\nCase studies:\r\n\r\n# The customer who had already written a functional specification\r\n# The customer who we didn’t see for the whole project\r\n# The customer who didn’t know that the team was using Scrum\r\n# The customer who emigrated to Australia during the project",

However, although agile methods improve on traditional processes, they neither replace the need for basic techniques or teach them. This presentation teaches the essential practical techniques that you need whatever method you are using, agile or not: \r\n\r\n* essential project documentation - telling stakeholders what you’re doing\r\n* functional design - communicating requirements to programmers\r\n* software development estimation - making cost predictions\r\n* essential system documentation - avoiding being on-call for ever.\r\n\r\nWriting everything down up-front is easy (but a bad idea): the art of being agile is knowing what you can leave out while still addressing all of a development project’s issues. This session teaches you how.",

But JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, dynamically typed language. JavaScript functions are the first class citizens that can live their own lives. But mastering JavaScript can present a challenge to Java developers who quickly find themselves in the Wild West Land of dynamic programming.\r\n\r\nWhy you may want to learn JavaScript? \r\n\r\nFirst, learning how things done in another language makes you a better Java developer. \r\nSecond, HTML5 becomes a new buzzword and adding JavaScript to your skill set make you more valuable software developer. You may not know the best kept secret – any HTML5 project is about learning some new tags, APIs and CSS,but mainly it’s about writing JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this presentation is to introduce you to this interesting language highlighting the differences with the Java way of doing stuff.",

However, business logic and data services would typically be coded using JavaScript or native (e.g. Objective-C) code – neither are ideal for most Java developers. In this session, we will discuss a new framework (Oracle Application Development Framework Mobile) that enable developers to declaratively create HTML5-based user interfaces using JavaServer Faces-like components. For business logic and data services, developers can either declaratively define or code in Java to create these service components. The exact same modules and code would run on both iOS and Android devices. Furthermore, the framework integrates PhoneGap to provide strong device integration, which allows Java developers to create powerful mobile application across different device types. Includes demos on iOS and Android.",

He’s recently been very interested in functional languages and the decision to study a few ones – Clojure, F#, JRuby and Scala – shapes his current self-learning activities. He also keeps on eye on current developments in Android and OSGi technology areas. He’s the founder and a co-leader of the Warszawa Java User Group (Warszawa JUG) that runs the Confitura and warsjawa conferences in Warsaw, Poland. He’s a book reviewer of IT books, mostly about Java EE, but you may check it out yourself whether or not that still holds true.\r\nHe is a Certified IT Specialist (Level 2) for IBM WebSphere in IBM Poland, so you might find a pinch of a bias towards IBM WebSphere stuff here and there.

If you've ever considered concurrent programming in Java, you know it's hard to do it right. With Clojure it's much easier and hence it's often referred to as \"a small library for concurrent programming\".",

Android rise pretty fast thanks to large developer community of Java.\r\nHowever in real world Android is not alone! Many mobile devices running iOS and Blackberry are also exist in mobile universe. \r\nHTML5+phonegap apps promised a magic silverbullet for write once run on all devices approach via several frameworks which in the end offered painful javascript and css development. While GWT offers a great Java to JS compiler and debugger, MGWT introduces native looking widgets both on ios, android and even blackberry. Also with the addition of gwt-phonegap projects, now you can code native looking html apps which can use native apis only with regular Java without coding a single line of html+JS.\r\nThis talk had been highly rated at Android Dev Days Istanbul and Ankara also still waiting for approval to be on JavaOne 2012.",

However, before considering performance the site must work reliably across all required devices.  In recent years many of the approaches adopted to achieve high performance rely on the excessive use of JavaScript or techniques supported by only a limited set of devices.  These approaches lead to reduced reliability and support across different devices and higher testing and maintenance costs.  This talk will describe multiple techniques used to progressively enhance performance for web sites without reducing device support.",

    "summary": "For Java developers who want to work with the language and platform they love, the last two years have proven to be ground-breaking ones. Java SE 7 was released after a long five-year and brought many new features to make a Java programmer’s life simpler. Such features include reduced generics syntax, safe file handling, making large numbers etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, wouldn’t it be fun to be able to add your own favourite features to Java?\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we give an introduction to hacking the Java compiler by showing you how to implement a relatively simple new language syntax feature: the Elvis operator.\r\n\r\nYou will learn:\r\n- how to download and build the Java compiler source code\r\n- how a compiler works and an overview of the Java compiler architecture\r\n- how to modify the Java syntax and grammar\r\n- how to implement the Elvis operator as a feature of Java\r\n- how to test your implementation",
