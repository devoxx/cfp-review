  "title": "Opening opensource : the Jenkins way",
  "summary": "Jenkins (formerly known as Hudson) is one of the most used tool in Java (non exclusive) to support continuous integration. Created as a hobby project, it quickly became a strategic tool for most development teams. Designed for extensibility, it also choosed from beginning an incremental development model, applying literally the 'release early, release often' principle. It focussed on building a large, active community, with the lowest contribution barrier I ever seen on opensource project and a complete transparency on project management, making Jenkins something uncommon in opensource world. \r\nDuring this session, I'll explain the Jenkins management & technical model, how it promotes contribution and how it allow CloudBees to both support the opensource community-driven project and deliver business value with proprietary extensions.",
