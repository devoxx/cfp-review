    "summary": "Jenkins (formerly known as Hudson) is one of the most used tool in Java (non exclusive) to support continuous integration. Created as a hobby project, it quickly became a strategic tool for most development teams. Designed for extensibility, it also choosed from beginning an incremental development model, applying literally the 'release early, release often' principle. It focussed on building a large, active community, with the lowest contribution barrier I ever seen on opensource project and a complete transparency on project management, making Jenkins something uncommon in opensource world. \r\nDuring this session, I'll explain the Jenkins management & technical model, how it promotes contribution and how it allow CloudBees to both support the opensource community-driven project and deliver business value with proprietary extensions.",

However, there are no industry standards for service versioning, thus leaving the responsibility of implementing a service versioning system up to the architects and developers within the IT enterprise. \r\n\r\nWe often see design-type versioning, resulting in Big Bang governance strategies. A runtime versioning strategy may be, in fact, be preferable.\r\n\r\nEvery change must be built, and every change must be governed. A \"cheap\" build may lead to a large governance impact. But conversely, a small governance cost may lead to a large build impact. Both build and governance costs need to be taken into account and carefully balanced when choosing and implementing a service versioning strategy.",

    "summary": "Once JavaME had ruled the mobile world. Times have changed and JavaME is not really preferred on any modern device today. Android rise pretty fast thanks to large developer community of Java.\r\nHowever in real world Android is not alone! Many mobile devices running iOS and Blackberry are also exist in mobile universe. \r\nHTML5+phonegap apps promised a magic silverbullet for write once run on all devices approach via several frameworks which in the end offered painful javascript and css development. While GWT offers a great Java to JS compiler and debugger, MGWT introduces native looking widgets both on ios, android and even blackberry. Also with the addition of gwt-phonegap projects, now you can code native looking html apps which can use native apis only with regular Java without coding a single line of html+JS.\r\nThis talk had been highly rated at Android Dev Days Istanbul and Ankara.",
